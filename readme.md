# HTML & CSS - Animating & Transforming


## Description

I made a landing page for a fictional game


the animations are as follows
- the logo rotates on hover
- the text shakes on hover
- the button scales and changes color on hover
- the shooting stars and paper planes fly across the screen using the animation property and @keyframes rule along with the image of a mountain falling from the sky with some cubic-bezier

The javascript in the project is mostly from Pedros coding class except the dark mode toggle is mine.
